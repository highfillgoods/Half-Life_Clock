Half-Life 1 Talking Clock

The original script worked great for 12 hour time.
This modified script is able to play hours 21-23 using 24 hour time format.


# How do I setup the talking clock ?
The setup is very simple:

Download the wavs.rar and pearl scrip files.
cd into the script directory, "cd half_life_talking_clock"
execute the script "./half-life_clock.pl" to hear the current time.

NOTE: you will need the binary "play" for the script to play the wav files. On Ubuntu install the sox package using "sudo apt-get install sox". On OpenBSD 5.1 use "pkg_add -i sox-14.3.2.tgz". The FreeBSD install of sox should be similar.


# How do I use different voices in the clock ?

Just replace the files in the wavs directory with the sound files with say the proper numbers. The script does not care as long as "play" can play the sound file format.

# Why was this script made ?
We loved the original Half-Life 1998 game and thought it would be great to hear the HEV speak the time every hour at home. The sounds were freely available on the game disk and online. From the last google search (136 million results found) you can find all the sound files anywhere online.

To Valve, please don't send us any nasty-grams. We made this for the love of the game!
